### Create a Workspace 

```
mkdir training_ws
cd training_ws && mkdir src && cd src
```

### Clone the repository into src

```
git clone https://github.com/shalman-khan/ros_training_ex4.git
```
<br>

### Environment Setup for Moveit2 [This process may take a while]

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-moveit 
cd ros_training_ex4
chmod +x moveit2_env_setup.sh
./moveit2_env_setup.sh
```

Write a Service client from scratch in ___moveit_test_node.cpp___ located in ___moveit_exercise package___ [src]
  1) Create a service client for ___spawn_collision_object___ service to spawn Aruco Marked Collision Object in RViz
  2) Use ___transformPose___ function to determine the pose of Aruco Marked Collision Object with respect to Static Camera
  3) Use ___spawnCollisionInScene___ function to spawn collision object in the planning scene.
  4) Use ___setTargetPoseWithOffset___ function to set target pose based on Aruco Marked Collision Object with offset
  
### To test the outcome:

Terminal 1:
```
cd ~/training_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch cam_launch_pkg cam.launch.py
```

Terminal 2:
```
cd ~/training_ws
source install/setup.bash

ros2 run ros2_aruco aruco_node

# For Simulation Mode
ros2 run ros2_aruco aruco_node --ros-args -p sim:=true

```

Terminal 3:
```
cd ~/training_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch moveit2_tutorials demo.launch.py
```


Terminal 4:
```
cd ~/training_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch moveit_exercise moveit_collision_client.launch.py
```
